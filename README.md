# Security Frameworks
<h2>Description</h2>
This lab will look at different Security Frameworks and will updated from time to time as learn different frameworks in my independent studies. <br>
<h2>What is a Security Framework?</h2>
A security framework can defined as policies and procedures for establishing and maintaining security controls. A framework identiies the processes used to defend a organization from security risks. This will allow secuirty professionals to keep their organizations compliant and protected from threats.

<h2>NIST Special Publication 800-37</h2>
 
 
 
 <h2>NIST Special Publication 800-53</h2>
 <strong> What:</strong> NIST 800-53 is security standard and compliance framework created by the National Institute of Standards in Technology (NIST). This framework is regulary updated with a goal to define controls, assemetments, and standard based on the factors of risk, cost efficiency, and capability. <br />
 <strong> Who For:</strong> This compliance standard needs to be met by federal information systems, agencies, and associated government contractors and departments that work with the government. <br />
 <strong> Purpose:</strong>Provide a foundation of guiding elements, strategies, systems, and controls to meet secuirty needs <br />
 <strong> Benefits:</strong> Comprehensive framework that if followed to a limited level of controls a majority of risk factors are still covered while offering the ability to improve on the baseline as needs of a organization become more prevailent. <br />
 <strong> Security / Access Control Baseline:</strong> <br />
  <strong>High Impact:</strong> Information Protected  <br />
 <strong> Medium Impact:</strong> Privledge commands controlled  <br />
  <strong>Low Impact:</strong> Monitored & Mangaged  <br />
 <strong> Controls:</strong> <br />
 <strong>AC (Access control):</strong> Account management and monitoring, enforcing the policy of least privilege principle, and separation of duties.
 <strong>AT (Awareness and training):</strong> Providing awareness and security training to employees, and elevated technical training for more privileged users.
 <strong>AU (Audit and accountability):</strong> Auditing records and content, retaining records, and providing associated analysis and reporting<br />
 <strong>CA (Assessment, authorization and monitoring):</strong> Penetration testing, and monitoring connections to public networks and external systems<br />
 <strong>CM (Configuration management):</strong> Implementing configuration change controls, and setting authorized software policies<br />
 <strong>CP (Contingency planning):</strong> Establishing and testing business continuity strategies, as well as alternate processing and storage sides.<br />
 <strong>IA (Identification and authentication):</strong> Managing credentials and setting up authentication policies and systems in place for users, devices, and services.<br />
 <strong>IP (Individual participation):</strong> Obtaining consent and authorizing privacy policies and practices.<br />
 <strong>IR (Incident response):</strong> Setting up incident response training and setting up associated monitoring and reporting systems.<br />
 <strong>MA (Maintenance):</strong> Having an ongoing system, personnel, and tool maintenance.<br />
 <strong>MP (Media protection):</strong> Securing and protecting media access, use, storage, and transportation.<br />
 <strong>PA (Privacy authorization):</strong> Setting policies for collecting, using, and sharing personally identifiable information(PII).<br />
 <strong>PE (Physical and environmental protection): </strong>Ensuring access to emergency power, securing physical access, and protecting against physical risk and damage.<br />
 <strong>PM (Program management):</strong> Having defined strategies for risk management, insider threats, and scaling architecture.<br />
 <strong>PL (Planning):</strong> Having strategies in place for comprehensive security architecture (such as defense in depth and third-party vendor security).<br />
 <strong>PS (Personnel security):</strong> Screening internal and external personnel, setting up termination and transfer security policies.<br />
 <strong>RA (Risk assessment):</strong> Scanning vulnerabilities, having ongoing privacy impact, and risk assessments.<br />
 <strong>SA (System and services acquisition):</strong> Implementing security across the system development lifecycle, new vendor contracts, and acquisitions.<br />
 <strong>SC (System and communications protection):</strong> Partitioning applications, implementing cryptographic key management, and securing passwords and other sensitive data.<br />
 <strong>SI (System and information integrity): </strong>Implementing system monitoring, alerting systems, and flaw remediation processes
