<h2>NIST Special Publication 800-37</h2>
 
 
 
 <h2>NIST Special Publication 800-53</h2>
 <strong> What:</strong> NIST 800-53 is security standard and compliance framework created by the National Institute of Standards in Technology (NIST). This framework is regulary updated with a goal to define controls, assemetments, and standard based on the factors of risk, cost efficiency, and capability. <br />
 <strong> Who For:</strong> This compliance standard needs to be met by federal information systems, agencies, and associated government contractors and departments that work with the government. <br />
 <strong> Purpose:</strong>Provide a foundation of guiding elements, strategies, systems, and controls to meet secuirty needs <br />
 <strong> Benefits:</strong> Comprehensive framework that if followed to a limited level of controls a majority of risk factors are still covered while offering the ability to improve on the baseline as needs of a organization become more prevailent. <br />
 <strong> Security / Access Control Baseline:</strong> <br />
  <strong>High Impact:</strong> Information Protected  <br />
 <strong> Medium Impact:</strong> Privledge commands controlled  <br />
  <strong>Low Impact:</strong> Monitored & Mangaged  <br />
 <strong> Controls:</strong> <br />
  <strong> Best Pratices:</strong> <br />
